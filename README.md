## üéÆ Game Overview

In this immersive 3D adventure, players explore interconnected rooms while collecting rose petals to restore a sacred relic. The game features interactive NPCs represented as pumpkins, offering both help and obstacles throughout the journey. The objective is to restore a mystical rose to its original sacred state by collecting all its scattered petals.

### Combat System
- Ray tracing implementation for precise hit detection
- Hitbox visualization system for debugging (`enemySkeleton.js`)
- Real-time collision detection between projectiles and enemies
- Debug visualization tools for hitboxes and collision areas
- Skeleton enemy AI with proximity-based attack patterns
- Location: `src/characters/enemySkeleton.js`

### Input and Controls

#### Basic Controls
- `W/A/S/D`: Movement
- `Mouse`: Look around
- `Left Click`: Shoot
- `Right Click`: Aim
- `P`: Enter doors
- `T`: Talk to pumpkins
- `E`: Interact with objects
- `ESC`: Pause menu

#### Debug Controls
For developers:
- Toggle hitbox visualization in `enemySkeleton.js`
- Customizable animation parameters through GUI
- Real-time pose control system for character animations

### Character Movement
- Smooth camera following with collision detection
- Physics-based movement system
- Dynamic rotation handling
- Reference: `src/controllers/characterMovement.js`

### Development Tools

#### Debug Features
- Hitbox visualization for enemies
- Animation control GUI
- Pose saving/loading system
- Real-time physics debugging

For detailed implementation of specific systems, refer to:
- Combat System: `src/characters/enemySkeleton.js`
- Movement Controls: `src/controllers/Input.js`
- Character Physics: `src/controllers/characterMovement.js`
- Room Generation: `src/scenes/RoomBase.js`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- Three.js for 3D graphics rendering
- Cannon.js for physics simulation
- Custom animation system with a mix of IK (Inverse Kinematics) and keyframing through interpolation
- Modular room-based architecture

### Key Technical Features

#### Animation System
- Hybrid animation system combining procedural and keyframe animations
- IK (Inverse Kinematics) implementation using CCDIKSolver
- Custom pose control system with GUI for animation debugging and keyframing
- Real-time pose interpolation for smooth transitions
- Location: `src/animations/HybridAnimationSystem.js`, `ShootAnimationSystem.js`, `...`

#### Character System
- Physics-based character controller with collision detection
- Shooting mechanics using raycasting
- State-based animation management
- Bone-based animation system with pose interpolation
- See: `src/characters/characterModel.js`

#### Room Management 
- Dynamic room loading and unloading system
- Room-based state management
- Efficient memory handling through object pooling
- Reference: `src/scenes/RoomManager.js`, `RoomBase.js`

#### Combat & Interaction Systems
- Ray tracing implementation for precise shooting mechanics
- Real-time collision detection
- Environmental interaction system
- Audio management with spatial sound
- Check: `src/controllers/Combat.js`, `Audio.js`

## üöÄ Future Development Potential

The modular architecture allows for:
- Additional rooms and gameplay mechanics
- Enhanced NPC behavior systems
- Extended combat mechanics
- More complex puzzle implementations
- Fine tuning of esthetics and artistic side
